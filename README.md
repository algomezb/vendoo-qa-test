# Vendoo QA Engineer Test
Welcome to the Vendoo QA Engineer test project. This project is a testing ground for QA engineers to demonstrate their knowledge of automated testing with end-to-end test with Cypress (end-to-end). The project has been created to mimic Vendoo's real web application project.

## Installation steps
In order to get this project running on your local machine please do the following:

1. Install node v10 https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Run `npm install` at the root folder
3. Run `npm start` to start the local version of the application
4. Ren `npm run e2e` to start the end to end testing

## QA Engineer Test
The following 5 tasks are the features we need tested. Each task has a brief explanation of what we required. If you need more explanation or have any question feel free to email chris@vendoo.co

You are not required to finish all 5 tasks, we rather see one very strong test versus 5 fragile test. You have a total of 20 hours to complete as many tests as possible.

### Task 1) Test Registeration

### Task 2) Test Login

### Task 3) Submitting form

### Task 4) Test filtering inventory

### Task 5) Test listing
